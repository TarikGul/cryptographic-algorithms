# Welcome To the Crypo Algos Repo

This is a place for me to jump between different Programming languages and write interpretations of different cryptographic algorithms. 

Recently added:

Python - Blowfish(BCrypt)
Javascript - Blowfish(BCrypt)

Up Next:

Ruby - Blowfish

I should add a salt generator as well for Blowfish

Python - Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
