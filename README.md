# Welcome To the Crypo Algos Repo

So far what is complete: all of the symmetric key ciphers in Javascript
are finished, some have their decoding algorithms written. 

Symmetric Key algorithms are almost done for ruby, i just need to finish two more 
of them. 

I plan on tackling modern symmetric keys next, including writing custom fiestel 
networks.

Feel free to contribute and add other languages :).
