# Welcome To the Crypo Algos Repo

This is a place for me to jump between different Programming languages and write interpretations of different cryptographic algorithms. 

Recently added:

C - LOKI91
C - DES

Up Next:

Ruby - Blowfish

I should add a salt generator as well for all the Blowfish interpretations

Python - Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
