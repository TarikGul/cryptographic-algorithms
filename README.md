# Welcome To the Crypo Algos Repo

This is a place for me to jump between different Programming languages and write interpretations of different cryptographic algorithms. 

This repo is need of a giant overhaul and organization. I also want to write a CLI in Rust for this as well. 

Recently added:

C - LOKI91
C - DES

Up Next:

Javascript ChaCha20

Ruby - Blowfish

I should add a salt generator as well for all the Blowfish interpretations

Python - Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
